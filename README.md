# Angular Info
### Create an Angular app in an existing folder without generating a duplicate folder
1. Ensure your terminal folder is the folder in which is your app folder
1. ng new myapp --directory=./

## Lifecycle Hook
A [Lifecycle Hook](https://angular.io/guide/glossary#lifecycle-hook) is an interface that allows you to tap into the lifecycle of [directives](https://angular.io/guide/glossary#directive) and [components](https://angular.io/guide/glossary#component) as they are created, updated, or destroyed.

For example, having an ngOnInit() in a component is a good place to put initialization logic.
